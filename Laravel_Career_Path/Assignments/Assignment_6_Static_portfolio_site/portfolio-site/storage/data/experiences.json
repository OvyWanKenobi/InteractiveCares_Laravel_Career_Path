        "summary": "Upon graduation, I began my career as a Junior Web Developer at Habro Systems Limited, a small company based in Gulshan-1, Dhaka. Over my 8-month tenure, I developed two major live projects from scratch, consulted by my supervisor, Nasimul Gani Sir. One is Bulk SMS Provider System, another is the company's portfolio site. These products were recognised for their exceptional user experience, showcasing my ability to deliver high-quality solutions. Although being the best creative mind in a small team, I gained many new knowledges from my valuable experience, marking my first venture into live commercial projects. I also contributed by debugging and enhancing features in other products, particularly improving front-end design. Additionally, I integrated the Bkash payment system into their multiple products that previously relied on manual confirmations, and delivered several small managerial apps tailored to company needs."
